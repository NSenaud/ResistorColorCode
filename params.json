It is a very simple way to control a resistor when your working on electronic projects.\r\n\r\n## Current Features\r\n=================\r\nSimply click on colors buttons to get a resistor value from its three first bands.\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot at startup](https://github.com/NSenaud/ResistorColorCode/blob/master/Screen%20Shots/Screen%20Shot%201.png?raw=true)\r\n![Typing the resistor's bands value](https://github.com/NSenaud/ResistorColorCode/blob/master/Screen%20Shots/Screen%20Shot%202.png?raw=true)\r\n![Result!](https://github.com/NSenaud/ResistorColorCode/blob/master/Screen%20Shots/Screen%20Shot%203.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n## What's next?\r\n=================\r\nI hope to be able to improve design, to get color on buttons unless the color name, and why not to add Dictation support.
